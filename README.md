# Chain Generator
 This is the final project for 3D computer graphics.  
It is a Maya python script that will allow for a user 
to create a multitude of chains that either 
can follow along a bezier curve or in a straight line.

Simply open the script in the Maya script editor, and
run the code to bring up the generator UI.
